## Instructions
## Task 1.Student grade generator.
`studentGrader()` .This function is designed to prompt the user to input student marks and, based on the provided input, determine and display the corresponding grade. 
In the studentGrade function, you need to:
* Use `if` and `else if` statements to determine the correct grade based on the student's input marks.
*Ensure that the function checks if the input marks are a valid number between 0 and 100.
*Return the calculated grade based on the input marks.
-The basic syntax of the if...else statement is as follows:
if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if the condition is false
}
## Task 2.Speed detector function.
`speedDetector()`.This function is used to detect the speed of a car and determine if any demerit points should be assigned based on the speed relative to a speed limit. It provides feedback on the car's speed and the demerit points if applicable.
The speed detector function should;
*Print "Ok": If the car's speed is within the speed limit (70 km/h).
*Return "Points: [demeritPoints]": If the car's speed exceeds the speed limit, it will return the calculated demerit points. The demerit points are calculated as (speed - speedLimit) / 5.
*Print "License suspended": If the car's speed results in 12 or more demerit points, indicating a suspended license.

## Task 3.

## Net salary calculator function.
`calculateNetSalary()`This is a JavaScript functiom is used to calculate an individual's net salary by taking into account various deductions and rates, including PAYE (Tax), NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund) deductions, NSSF (National Social Security Fund) deductions, and the Affordable Housing Levy.
